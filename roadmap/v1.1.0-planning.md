## üöß Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **WireGuard Integration**: Native library complexity
   - *Mitigation*: Early POC validation, fallback to Xray
2. **Compose Migration**: Breaking UI changes
   - *Mitigation*: Gradual migration, feature flags
3. **AGP/Kotlin Upgrade**: Build system instability
   - *Mitigation*: Experimental branch validation, rollback plan

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Feature expansion beyond capacity
   - *Mitigation*: Strict feature freeze after Sprint 0
2. **Resource Constraints**: Team bandwidth limitations
   - *Mitigation*: Parallel workstreams, external contractor support

## üîÑ Decision Gates

### Gate 1: Proceed to Development (Week 1)
**Criteria**: 
- Patch 1.0.1 metrics stable ‚â•72h
- Technical designs approved
- Resource allocation confirmed

### Gate 2: Feature Complete (Week 6)
**Criteria**:
- All core features functionally complete
- Performance targets met in testing
- Security scans passing

### Gate 3: Release Candidate (Week 8)
**Criteria**:
- Beta metrics meet quality targets
- No critical or high-severity issues
- Play Store optimization complete

## üìà Post-v1.1.0 Strategy

### Cross-Platform Evaluation
- **Decision Point**: After v1.1.0 public metrics achieved
- **Options**: Kotlin Multiplatform expansion vs Android-first approach
- **Criteria**: User demand, development velocity, market opportunity

### Major Release Planning (v2.0.0)
