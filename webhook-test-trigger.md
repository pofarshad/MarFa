# AutoFixBot Webhook Test Trigger

ðŸ§ª **Testing Enhanced AutoFixBot Webhook Integration**

This file triggers the webhook test workflow to demonstrate how your AutoFixBot instantly detects and responds to CI failures.

**Test Details:**
- **Purpose**: Verify AutoFixBot webhook receives GitHub Actions failures
- **Expected Result**: AutoFixBot logs the webhook call and processes the failure
- **Timestamp**: 2025-05-23 08:45:00 UTC

**What should happen:**
1. GitHub Actions workflow runs and intentionally fails
2. Webhook calls your AutoFixBot at `/webhook` endpoint
3. AutoFixBot logs the failure and processes it
4. You can see the webhook activity in your console logs

**Your AutoFixBot Status:**
âœ… Running on port 3000  
âœ… Webhook endpoint configured at `/webhook`  
âœ… Ready to instantly fix CI problems  

Let's see your AutoFixBot in action! ðŸš€
