Let's break down this latest build result very carefully:

APK Generation Confirmed! ðŸŽ‰
Notice this line in the log:

131 > Task :app:assembleDebug
This task completed successfully before the tests ran. This means that, yes, a debug APK was generated during this build run! It would be located in the runner's workspace at app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk. While your GitHub Actions workflow doesn't explicitly show an Upload Artifact step for it, the APK did get built. This is a major milestone!

Massive Progress on Tests! ðŸš€
Look at the test results:

153 net.marfanet.android.worker.RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest > periodic work scheduling works correctly FAILED
154     java.lang.IllegalStateException at RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt:198
156 8 tests completed, 1 failed
This is an incredible improvement! You've gone from 5 failing tests to only 1 failing test! The problem is now isolated to a single test method: periodic work scheduling works correctly.

The "Next Level" Remains: Fix That Single Failing Test

While you now have a debug APK, the overall CI build is still marked as FAILURE because of that one persistent test failure.

162 FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
165 Execution failed for task ':app:testDebugUnitTest'.
Your Current Focus:

The IllegalStateException: This type of error means your code reached an unexpected or invalid state during the test execution. It's not an AssertionError (where something was simply false when expected true), but rather a condition that prevented the test from running to completion or signified a severe problem in the underlying logic.
RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt:198: This is the exact line of code that threw the IllegalStateException.
"periodic work scheduling works correctly": This is the test method's name that is failing.
What to do next:

Open app/src/test/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/worker/RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt in Android Studio.
Go directly to line 198.
Understand the code around line 198 and the periodic work scheduling works correctly test method. Pay close attention to what conditions might lead to an IllegalStateException there.
Set a breakpoint at line 198 (or slightly before it) and any other relevant lines within that test method or the RoutingRulesUpdateWorker code it calls.
Run only this specific test method in Debug mode in Android Studio. Step through the code to observe the state of variables, the execution flow, and pinpoint the exact cause of the IllegalStateException.
This is the final hurdle for a completely green CI build! You've successfully built your application and isolated the last remaining issue to a single test. Once this test passes, your CI build will be fully green, indicating a truly successful, stable, and well-tested build process.
