1 • Overall Impression

The dashboard offers a clean single‑page navigation structure with logical grouping of Overview → Requirements → Analysis → Specs → Docs → Progress. Visual hierarchy supports rapid context‑switching between macro‑status and micro‑task details.

2 • Validation Checklist vs Super Prompt

Super Prompt Requirement

Reflected in Dashboard?

Notes

Clone repo & source‑level refactor

Partial

Repo URL referenced, but actual git status/branch list missing. Consider embedding webhook or polling GitHub API.

14‑point requirement matrix

Yes

Matrix present, but each cell needs link to evidence (commit hash, doc, or test result).

Automated refactor scripts

Stub

Dashboard references script generation but download returns placeholder. Need real Gradle or Bash scripts.

Xray JNI integration plan

Yes

Spec tab outlines ABI folders; good. Still need sample NativeBridge.kt skeleton file.

gfw‑knocker default embed

Listed

Provide Makefile / CGo flags artefact for downstream.

WARP UI removal

Missing proof

Add diff view showing deleted WarpPreferenceFragment.

Latency scanner & routing auto‑update

Yes

Progress card shows “In development”. Need ETA + unit‑test stub.

Perf benchmarking & static analysis

Placeholder

Hook ./gradlew lint detekt into CI widget.

Docs downloads

Works

VERIFY Tech_Report.md contains lint results and Perf_Report.md includes before/after metrics.

3 • UX & Functionality Feedback

Progress Tracking – Use Kanban or linear checklist with colour‑coded %; sync with Git commits.

Dependency Graph – Good start; add filter by risk score (e.g., obsolete, GPL‑incompatible).

Live CI Status – Integrate GitHub Actions badge; auto‑refresh.

Download Bundle – Provide aggregated .zip of source + docs. Confirm checksum on UI.

Security Scan Widget – Integrate OWASP Dependency‑Check JSON; red‑flag critical CVEs.

4 • Next Action Items (High Priority)

Wire Code Evidence Links – Each requirement → ✅ only after attaching actual commit hash or file diff.

Generate Skeleton Native Bridge – Auto‑produce com/marfanet/xray/NativeBridge.kt and README in each jniLibs folder.

Export Automated Refactor Script – Add Bash/Gradle script performing global replace and package‑id change.

Add Unit‑Test Coverage Widget – Parse JaCoCo and display coverage %. Target ≥ 90 % for parser & latency modules.

Enable CI Webhook – On git push, update dashboard progress; fail‑fast on lint/test errors.

5 • Acceptance Gates Still Open

Lint/Detekt score A

TestDebugUnitTest exit 0

Static‑analysis no Critical/High

README_BUILD.md finalised

6 • Conclusion & Recommendations

Solid foundation. To declare Milestone 1 Done, attach tangible artefacts (scripts, skeleton code, coverage reports) and wire CI feedback into dashboard. Once those are in place, move to Milestone 2: routing integration & perf optimisation.
