The build successfully completed all compilation tasks, including the main application code and all the test code. This means all previous issues (missing source directories, Kotlin/Compose version mismatches, and missing dependencies for both main code and test code like Robolectric, WorkManager testing, and MockWebServer) have been resolved!

However, the build still fails, but for a completely different and more advanced reason: your tests are failing at runtime.

Look at these critical lines:

153 > Task :app:testDebugUnitTest
154 net.marfanet.android.worker.RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest > worker updates progress during operation FAILED
155     java.lang.AssertionError at RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt:151
156 net.marfanet.android.worker.RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest > worker detects unchanged file correctly FAILED

171 8 tests completed, 5 failed
The Problem: Failing Unit Tests

The build is no longer failing because a file can't be found or a dependency is missing during compilation.
The code compiled fine.
The issue now is that when the compiled unit tests are executed, 5 out of 8 of them fail.
Types of Failures:

java.lang.AssertionError: This means that one of your test assertions (e.g., assertEquals, assertTrue, assertNotNull, assertThat) failed. The actual result of your code did not match the expected result defined in your test. This is usually a sign of a bug in the application code being tested, or an incorrect assumption in the test logic itself.
java.lang.IllegalStateException: This indicates that your code (or a library it uses) reached an invalid state during execution. This could be due to unexpected data, an incorrect sequence of operations, or a method being called when it shouldn't be.
The Next Step: Debugging Failing Tests

Since this is no longer a build configuration problem but a logical one, you (the human developer) will need to:

Examine the Test File: Open app/src/test/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/worker/RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
Locate Failing Tests: Look at the test methods named in the log:
worker updates progress during operation (line 154) - See line 151 in the test file.
worker detects unchanged file correctly (line 156) - See line 69 in the test file.
worker creates rules directory if not exists (line 158) - See line 130 in the test file.
periodic work scheduling works correctly (line 160) - See line 185 in the test file.
worker downloads and saves rules file successfully (line 167) - See line 46 in the test file.
Understand the Assertions/Illegal States:
For AssertionError, understand what the test is expecting and what the code is actually providing.
For IllegalStateException, understand the conditions under which that exception is thrown (either by your code or a library) and why those conditions were met.
Run Tests Locally and Debug:
This is where having the project running in Android Studio (as discussed previously) is crucial.
You can right-click on the RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt file in Android Studio and select "Run 'RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest'".
You can set breakpoints at the specific lines mentioned in the error messages (e.g., line 151, 69, 130, 185, 46).
Run the tests in "Debug" mode (by clicking the debug icon or right-clicking and selecting "Debug").
Step through the code line by line, inspect variable values, and observe the execution flow to pinpoint why the tests are failing.
In essence: The build setup is now correct. The tools are installed, the dependencies are there, and the compiler is happy. The problem has shifted from "can't build" to "built it, but the code doesn't do what the tests say it should." This means the debugging process now involves analyzing the logic of your application code or your test code, not the build system.
