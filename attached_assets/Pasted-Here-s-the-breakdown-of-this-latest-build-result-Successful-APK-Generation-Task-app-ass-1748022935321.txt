Here's the breakdown of this latest build result:

Successful APK Generation âœ…:

> Task :app:assembleDebug completed successfully. This means your debug APK is being generated without any issues.
ALL Unit Tests Passed! ðŸŽ‰ (This is HUGE!)

Notice the absence of > Task :app:testDebugUnitTest FAILED and no more test failure reports like 8 tests completed, 1 failed.
The testDebugUnitTest task simply runs and then the build proceeds.
This confirms that you have successfully fixed the IllegalStateException in RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt and all your unit tests are now passing! This is a massive milestone.
The New (and Final) Problem: Lint Errors Breaking the Build ðŸ”´
The build is now failing exclusively on the lint task, which is a static code analysis tool.

163 > Task :app:lintDebug FAILED
164 Lint found 2 errors, 118 warnings. First failure:
165 /home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/app/src/main/res/values-night/themes_amoled.xml:29: Error: android:windowLightStatusBar requires API level 23 (current min is 21) [NewApi]
...
176 Execution failed for task ':app:lintDebug'.
177 > Lint found errors in the project; aborting build.
Errors: You now have only 2 errors (down from 32!) and 118 warnings. The lint task is configured to fail the build if any errors are found.
Specific Error: The first error is NewApi for android:windowLightStatusBar in themes_amoled.xml. This means you are using an API feature (introduced in API 23) in a project that supports a minimum API level (like 21).
The "Next Level" Remains: Achieve a Fully Green CI Build!

You are truly at the very, very last step for a green CI workflow. The app compiles, the tests pass, and the APK is generated. The only thing preventing a "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" message is lintDebug.

To fix this specific NewApi lint error:

The error message android:windowLightStatusBar requires API level 23 (current min is 21) is telling you that the attribute android:windowLightStatusBar can only be used on devices running API level 23 (Android 6.0) or higher. Your app, however, declares a minSdkVersion of 21. If this attribute were used on an Android 5.0 device, it would crash or behave unexpectedly.

The best way to handle this is to apply the style conditionally based on the API level:

Locate the File: app/src/main/res/values-night/themes_amoled.xml
Move the Specific Line: Move the line <item name="android:windowLightStatusBar">false</item> from this file to a new file.
Create a New Directory for API 23+ Resources:
Inside app/src/main/res/, create a new folder called values-v23.
Inside values-v23/, create a file named themes_amoled.xml (or themes.xml if your themes are simple).
Place the Attribute in the New File:
In app/src/main/res/values-v23/themes_amoled.xml, add the following (assuming it's part of a theme):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <style name="Theme.MarFaNet" parent="Theme.MarFaNet.Base">
        <!-- If the parent theme is not defined in this API level, define it in the base values folder -->
        <!-- Assuming the style is defined in Theme.MarFaNet style -->
        <item name="android:windowLightStatusBar">false</item>
    </style>
</resources>
Important: Make sure the style tag in themes_amoled.xml in values-v23 has the exact same name and parent as your original Theme.MarFaNet style in the base values/themes_amoled.xml (or themes.xml) file. Android will automatically pick the values-v23 version on devices API 23 and above, and ignore it on older devices.
If the AI claims it fixed this, it might have done one of these things:

It might have increased your minSdkVersion to 23 (check your build.gradle.kts). If it did, and you still want to support 21, you'll need to revert that change and do the conditional styling.
It might have suppressed the lint error, which is less ideal.
