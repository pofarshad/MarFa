My Android project, "MarFa," located at https://github.com/pofarshad/MarFa, is still failing its continuous integration (CI) build on GitHub Actions, but with a new error from the previous attempt. The previous issue concerning repository nesting seems to be resolved, as evidenced by successful execution of many Gradle tasks before the new failure point.

Problem Description:
The build now fails during the Build Debug APK step, specifically at the :app:compileDebugKotlin task. The core error message is:

e: This version (1.5.1) of the Compose Compiler requires Kotlin version 1.9.0 but you appear to be using Kotlin version 1.9.21 which is not known to be compatible. Please consult the Compose-Kotlin compatibility map located at https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-kotlin to choose a compatible version pair (or `suppressKotlinVersionCompatibilityCheck` but don't say I didn't warn you!).
This directly leads to FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. and Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugKotlin'. followed by Compilation error. See log for more details.

Observed Behavior:
The build process proceeds further than before, successfully downloading Gradle and executing various Android Gradle Plugin tasks. However, it hits a hard stop when the Kotlin compiler attempts to compile code, indicating a version mismatch between the Jetpack Compose Compiler and the installed Kotlin version.

Expected Behavior:
The Android application should compile successfully, compatible versions of Compose Compiler and Kotlin should be used, and a debug APK should be generated.

Hypothesis/Suspected Cause:
The problem is a direct incompatibility between the version of the Compose Compiler (1.5.1) declared in the project and the Kotlin version (1.9.21 or 1.9.23 as mentioned in the build summary) being used by the build. The Compose-Kotlin compatibility map must be consulted to align these versions.

Relevant Files/Locations for Inspection:

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/pofarshad/MarFa
Project-level build.gradle.kts (or build.gradle): To check the Kotlin Gradle plugin version. Example: plugins { kotlin("android") version "1.9.21" apply false } in build.gradle.kts.
App-module build.gradle.kts (or build.gradle): To check the Compose Compiler version. Example: compiler = "1.5.1" (or similar) in composeOptions or as a direct dependency.
Instructions/Request for AI Agent:

Analyze the project's Gradle files (specifically build.gradle.kts files at project and app level) to determine the currently configured Kotlin version and Compose Compiler version.
Consult the official Compose-Kotlin compatibility map (link provided in the error: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-kotlin).
Propose a solution to resolve the version incompatibility:
Option A (Recommended): Upgrade Compose Compiler. Recommend upgrading the androidx.compose.compiler:compiler version to one officially compatible with Kotlin 1.9.21 (or 1.9.23, depending on the actual Kotlin version used in the project configuration). For Kotlin 1.9.21/1.9.23, a Compose Compiler version like 1.5.8 or newer is typically required.
Option B (Alternative): Downgrade Kotlin. Suggest changing the Kotlin version in the project to 1.9.0, which is compatible with Compose Compiler 1.5.1. This is generally less preferred if newer Kotlin features are desired.
Provide specific code changes for the relevant Gradle build files (build.gradle.kts or build.gradle) to implement the chosen solution.
Explain the proposed fix and confirm that it directly addresses the CompilationErrorException caused by the version mismatch.
