Problem 1: Unresolved References in MainActivity.kt (During Compile)
This is the most critical error because it directly prevents your application code from compiling. It's happening in the "Lint & Static Analysis" job during the compileDebugKotlin task.

55 > Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED

What it means:
The AI agent's "new interface code" for MainActivity.kt is trying to use UI components or icons that the Kotlin compiler doesn't recognize. These look specifically like Material Design Icons for Jetpack Compose (e.g., Icons.Filled.Shield, Icons.Filled.Stop, etc.). Your project is missing the necessary dependency for these icons.

Solution:
You need to add the correct Material Icons dependency to your app/build.gradle.kts file.

Add this line under your dependencies { ... } block:

// For Material Design Icons (if your UI uses them, which it appears to)
implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:1.X.X") // Use same version as your compose.ui
// Or if you only need the core filled icons:
// implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-core:1.X.X") // Use same version as your compose.ui
Important: Replace 1.X.X with the same Material Compose version you're already using (or make sure you use a compatible version with your androidx.compose.ui dependency, e.g., 1.5.0 or 1.5.8). If the Material Icons are Filled or Outlined, material-icons-extended usually covers both.

Problem 2: jacocoTestReport Task Not Found (During Unit Tests)
This is happening in the "Unit & Instrumentation Tests" job.

38 Task 'jacocoTestReport' not found in root project 'MarFaNet' and its subprojects.
What it means:
Your workflow is trying to run a Gradle task named jacocoTestReport, which is typically used to generate code coverage reports using the JaCoCo plugin. However, this task is not found, meaning the JaCoCo plugin is likely not applied correctly or its configuration is missing from your build.gradle.kts files.

Solution (You likely need to apply the JaCoCo plugin):

Check your app/build.gradle.kts:
Add the plugin: Ensure the JaCoCo plugin is applied.
plugins {
    // ... other plugins
    id("org.gradle.jacoco") // Add this line
}
Configure the task (example - specific configuration might vary):
You might also need a basic configuration block for JaCoCo:
// In your app/build.gradle.kts within your android { } block
android {
    // ...
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            // For JaCoCo to work correctly, testCoverageEnabled must be true for the build type you are testing
            isTestCoverageEnabled = true
        }
    }
}

tasks.withType<Test> {
    configure<JacocoTaskExtension> {
        // Ensure JaCoCo is configured for your tests, default should be fine
    }
}

// Example Task for code coverage report (often called jacocoTestReport)
// This might be automatically created by the plugin, but if you need a custom one:
// You might define jacocoTestReport task or rely on the plugin's default.
// It's possible the workflow is calling a non-existent task if it's not generated by default.
// Check Gradle's JaCoCo documentation for specific task names based on your version.
// For Android projects, the common task is `createDebugCoverageReport` or similar.
// If your workflow *explicitly* calls `jacocoTestReport`, make sure it exists or update the workflow.
It's more likely createDebugCoverageReport for Android, so your workflow command gradlew jacocoTestReport might be looking for a generic JVM project task. You might need to change jacocoTestReport in your workflow to createDebugCoverageReport.
Problem 3: Missing upload-artifact@v3 (During Security Scan)
This is happening in the "Security Vulnerability Scan" job, and it's the exact same problem we just fixed in the main CI job.

33 Error: Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3
What it means:
This specific job's workflow file (.github/workflows/your-security-scan-workflow.yml or it might be in a separate job within the main workflow) is still trying to use an outdated version of the upload-artifact action.

Solution:
Just like you did before, find and replace actions/upload-artifact@v3 with actions/upload-artifact@v4 in the workflow file for this particular job. (Go to your .github/workflows folder and check all .yml files if it's not obvious in the main one.)

Next Steps (in order of priority):

Fix Problem 3 immediately: Update upload-artifact to v4 in the Security Vulnerability Scan job's workflow. This is a quick one-line change.
Fix Problem 1: Add the Material Icons dependency to app/build.gradle.kts. This should resolve the Unresolved reference errors.
Fix Problem 2: Apply the JaCoCo plugin and potentially update the command in your workflow from jacocoTestReport to createDebugCoverageReport.
