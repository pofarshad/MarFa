Here's what the log shows:

Tests Still Running (and Passing? Most of them!) âœ…:
Notice that the testDebugUnitTest task appears to have completed without reporting any failures in the way it did before (e.g., 8 tests completed, 1 failed). This is progress on that front!

NEW Failure Point: The Lint Task! ðŸ”´
The build is now failing on a different task: :app:lintDebug FAILED.

146 > Task :app:lintDebug FAILED
147 Lint found 32 errors, 118 warnings. First failure:
148 /home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/app/src/main/res/values-night/colors_amoled.xml:5: Error: The color "colorPrimary" in values-night has no declaration in the base values folder; this can lead to crashes when the resource is queried in a configuration that does not match this qualifier [MissingDefaultResource]
...
174 Execution failed for task ':app:lintDebug'.
175 > Lint found errors in the project; aborting build.
The New Problem: Lint Errors Breaking the Build

Lint is a static code analysis tool that checks your project for potential bugs, usability issues, performance problems, accessibility concerns, and more. It helps enforce best practices. By default, CI often configures lint to fail the build if it finds any "errors."

Your lint check found:

32 Errors (these are failing the build)
118 Warnings (these are informational but can be annoying)
The first error is:
MissingDefaultResource: The color colorPrimary is defined in values-night/colors_amoled.xml but is missing from your base values/colors.xml file. This is a common lint error related to resource qualifiers.

What to do next:

You have two main paths to get a green build:

Path A: Fix All Lint Errors (Recommended for Long-Term Quality)
This is the proper way to maintain code quality. You need to address the 32 errors lint found.

Reproduce Lint Locally:
Open your project in Android Studio.
Go to Analyze > Inspect Code... and run a full inspection. This will typically show you all the lint issues within the IDE, often with helpful explanations and quick-fix suggestions.
Alternatively, run the lint task directly from your terminal: ./gradlew lintDebug
Fix the Errors:
Start by addressing the first reported error: MissingDefaultResource for colorPrimary. Ensure that every resource defined in a qualifier-specific file (like values-night/colors_amoled.xml) also has a default declaration in the base values/colors.xml (even if it's a dummy value or a duplicate if it makes sense).
Work through the other 31 errors. Android Studio often provides quick-fixes.
Path B: Configure Lint to Not Fail the Build (Less Recommended, but Gets a Green Build Immediately)
If you need to get a green build quickly and want to address lint issues later, you can configure lint to not fail the build on errors.

Open app/build.gradle.kts.

Find your android { ... } block.

Add or modify the lintOptions block:

android {
    // ... other android configurations
    lintOptions {
        abortOnError = false // This will prevent lint from failing the build
        // You can also set specific rules to be treated as errors or warnings:
        // disable 'MissingDefaultResource' // If you specifically want to ignore this particular error
        // error 'ColorUsage' // Example of making a warning an error
    }
}
WARNING: Setting abortOnError = false means your CI might pass even with serious static analysis errors. This is usually only a temporary workaround.

Path C: Use a Lint Baseline (Good for Gradual Fixes)
This is often a good compromise for projects with many existing lint errors. It creates a "snapshot" of current errors, and only new errors (introduced after the baseline is created) will cause the build to fail.

Open app/build.gradle.kts.

Add the baseline option to your lintOptions block:

android {
    // ...
    lintOptions {
        baseline = file("lint-baseline.xml") // Point to the baseline file
    }
}
Run the command to generate the baseline file:
./gradlew updateLintBaseline
This command will create lint-baseline.xml in your module's root directory. You should commit this file to your version control.

Subsequent CI builds will ignore the existing 32 errors, and only new ones will cause failures. You can then gradually fix the issues in the baseline file over time.

Summary for "Next Level":

You've made phenomenal progress. Your app compiles, and your tests (seemingly) all pass now. The final hurdle for a fully green CI build is the Lint errors.

My immediate recommendation: Start by trying to fix the MissingDefaultResource issue. If that proves tedious for all 32 errors, use the baseline approach (Path C) to get a green build and commit the baseline file, then address the warnings and errors incrementally.
