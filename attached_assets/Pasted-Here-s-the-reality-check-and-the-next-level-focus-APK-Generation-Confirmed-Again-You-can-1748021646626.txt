Here's the reality check and the "next level" focus:

APK Generation Confirmed (Again) âœ…:
You can see > Task :app:assembleDebug completed successfully. So, yes, you are generating a debug APK! This is a fantastic step.

Incredible Test Progress! ðŸš€ (But Not Fully Green Yet):
You've gone from 5 failing tests down to just 1 single failing test! This is monumental progress.
The specific test is: net.marfanet.android.worker.RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest > periodic work scheduling works correctly
And the error is still: java.lang.IllegalStateException at RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt:197

Overall Build Still Fails ðŸ”´:
Because that one test failed, the overall testDebugUnitTest task failed, and critically, the entire GitHub Actions job is still marked as FAILURE. For a truly "green" CI pipeline, you need all tests to pass.

The "Next Level" Remains: Fix That Last Failing Test!

The absolute next level is to make that 1 failing test pass so your gradlew build command exits with BUILD SUCCESSFUL for the first time.

Specific Action for You:

Go back to app/src/test/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/worker/RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
Locate line 197.
Focus exclusively on the periodic work scheduling works correctly test method.
The IllegalStateException indicates a runtime issue â€“ something is happening that puts the code into an invalid state. It's not a simple assertion failing, but a fundamental problem within the execution flow.
Debug this test locally in Android Studio. This is paramount.
Set a breakpoint at line 197 and anywhere within that test method where WorkManager is being interacted with or where potential state changes occur.
Run only this specific test method in Debug mode.
Carefully step through the test, observing the values of variables and the exact sequence of events.
The goal is to understand why the IllegalStateException is being thrown. Is there an object not initialized? Are you calling a method too early or too late? Is an invalid argument being passed to a WorkManager scheduling call?
Once you debug and fix that single IllegalStateException, your entire testDebugUnitTest task will pass, and your CI build will finally be green! You are incredibly close!
