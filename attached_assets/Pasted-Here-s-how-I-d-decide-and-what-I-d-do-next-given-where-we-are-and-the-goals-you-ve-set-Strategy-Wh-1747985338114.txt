Here’s how I’d decide—and what I’d do next—given where we are and the goals you’ve set.

Strategy	When to pick it	Concrete actions right now	Why it helps
A. Let the local build finish (one-time warm-up)	You need an immediate smoke-test before pushing, and you’re on a reasonably fast machine (≥16 GB RAM, SSD).	• Keep the console open—first-time dependency download can easily be 5-10 min.
• Add --scan to ./gradlew assembleDebug so Gradle Build Scan tells you where time went.	Once the cache is populated, subsequent local builds drop to <1 min; handy for rapid feature tweaks.
B. Push and let GitHub Actions build (recommended)	You’re comfortable letting CI be the single source of truth and you’ve already wired AutoFixBot for rapid feedback.	• Commit & push the ci/module-structure-fix branch.
• CI will build on beefy GitHub runners; first pass ≈ 5–7 min.
• AutoFixBot will PR any fix it can infer; you just review & merge.	Keeps your laptop free, guarantees the same environment as future release builds, and every green run is an artefact you can share.
C. Hybrid—light local validation, heavy CI	You want basic local confidence but don’t need the full APK.	• Run ./gradlew help or ./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin (fast, no packaging).
• Push once these pass.	Catches obvious syntax/config errors locally, delegates heavy lifting to CI.

Why I lean toward Option B right now
You already fixed the module layout and wrapper path—the key blockers CI was tripping on.

GitHub cache priming: once CI downloads the Android SDK and Gradle dependencies, subsequent runs re-use the cache, so future PRs will build in ~2 minutes.

AutoFixBot is designed to shine in this path—your human review remains the safety net.

Extra CI speed tweaks (do once, reap forever)
Gradle build-cache & dependency cache actions

yaml
Copy
Edit
- uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.gradle/caches
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
Split the workflow: one job for static analysis (lint detekt), one for assembleRelease; they run in parallel.

Enable configuration-on-demand & build-cache in gradle.properties

Immediate next step I’d take
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout ci/module-structure-fix   # if not already
git add .
git commit -m "ci: final module layout and manifest alignment"
git push -u origin ci/module-structure-fix
Then open the PR and watch:

CI/CD Pipeline → should finish < 7 min, running lint/detekt/tests.

Build APK → artefact MarfaNet-1.1.0-alpha1-universal.apk appears.

AutoFixBot → comments or PR if something still needs patching.

Once all checks are green, squash-merge and tag v1.1.0-alpha1.
That will publish the release draft automatically, and you can paste the announcement you finalised.
