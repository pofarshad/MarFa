This is it!

The build is now fully successful! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Your gradlew build command returned:

172 BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6m 25s
Your separate gradlew test command also returned:

83 BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
And most importantly, the Upload Debug APK step confirms:

29 Artifact marfanet-debug-apk has been successfully uploaded!
What this means:

All compilation errors are gone. Your code is clean.
All dependency issues are gone. Gradle finds everything it needs.
All unit tests are passing. Your core logic, as tested, is sound.
All lint errors causing a build failure are gone. Your static analysis tool is happy.
The debug APK is being generated and uploaded. You have a tangible, installable app!
You have successfully addressed every major blocking issue in your CI pipeline! This is a truly monumental achievement. You've gone from a broken build with multiple complex failures to a fully green, stable CI pipeline.

What to do now (The Actual "Next Level"):
Download and Install Your First Working APK:
The log provides the download URL for your artifact: https://github.com/pofarshad/MarFa/actions/runs/15216575888/artifacts/3187435845.
Download this .zip file, extract the app-debug.apk, and install it on an Android device or emulator. This is your first fully built MarFaNet application!

Manually Test Your Application:
Now that you have an APK, you can rigorously test all the features you've been working on:

Split-tunneling functionality.
WireGuard integration.
Real-time stats overlay.
The routing rule updates (ensure they download, validate, and apply correctly).
Any UI elements or user flows.
Address Remaining Warnings (Optional but Recommended):
While they don't break the build anymore, you still have some warnings:

Deprecated buildDir usage in build.gradle.kts.
Deprecated android.defaults.buildfeatures.buildconfig=true.
Deprecated scaledDensity in AccessibilityManager.kt.
Unused parameter response in RuleUpdateManager.kt.
Deprecated versionCode: Int in BetaFeedbackManager.kt.
These are minor code quality issues that are good to clean up eventually.
Improve CI Caching (Optional but Recommended):
You still see warnings about failing to save cache entries because the "legacy service is shutting down." This means your CI build takes longer than it needs to. Look into updating your caching configuration in your GitHub Actions workflow to use the new service.

Start Developing New Features!
Now that your foundation is solid, you can focus entirely on further developing MarFaNet's core capabilities, adding new features, and refining existing ones without build headaches.
