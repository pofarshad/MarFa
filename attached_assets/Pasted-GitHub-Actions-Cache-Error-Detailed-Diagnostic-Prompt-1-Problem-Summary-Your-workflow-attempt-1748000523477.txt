GitHub Actions Cache Error – Detailed Diagnostic Prompt

1. Problem Summary
Your workflow attempted to restore and save multiple Gradle caches, but encountered the following issues:

Cache not restored:
For key gradle-home-v1|Linux|build[5df42585ae8f8da228c604b8b4e8707c]-be4a88a71d4c9228cd47e76310ada7300421eab1, the cache was not restored.
Error: Cache service responded with 422 (Unprocessable Entity).
Cache not saved:
For all keys, the cache was not saved because “entry with key already exists”.
2. Root Causes & Explanation

422 Error on Restore:
The requested cache key does not exist in the cache backend, or the key is malformed/invalid.
Entry Not Saved:
GitHub Actions caching is content-addressable; once a cache with a given key exists, it cannot be overwritten.
Attempting to save with the same key (when contents are unchanged) will always skip saving.
3. What You Should Check

Ensure your cache keys are unique and deterministic, e.g., include file hashes or dependency lock file checksums.
For the gradle-home-v1 key, verify that the cache actually exists for this key. If not, the first run will always miss and subsequent runs can use the cache.
If you want to refresh/update a cache, increment the version component in your key (e.g., gradle-home-v2...).
Review the structure of your cache keys for typos or dynamic values that might change between runs, causing cache misses.
4. Actionable Recommendations

Confirm cache key versioning and uniqueness logic in your workflow YAML.
Clean up unused/expired caches at https://github.com/pofarshad/MarFa/actions/caches.
For Gradle in CI, consider using the official setup-gradle action for best caching practices:
GitHub Docs: Gradle Caching
Add debugging steps (e.g., print cache keys/restore status) to your workflow for better traceability.
5. Reference Example:

YAML
- name: Cache Gradle
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.gradle/caches
      ~/.gradle/wrapper
    key: gradle-home-v2-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
    restore-keys: |
      gradle-home-v2-${{ runner.os }}-
      gradle-home-v2-
Summary:
You are not losing any build artifacts, but cache efficiency is suboptimal. Adjust your cache keys and review workflow logic for better reuse and reliability.
