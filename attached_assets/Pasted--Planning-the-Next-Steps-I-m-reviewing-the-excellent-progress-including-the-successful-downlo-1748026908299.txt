**Planning the Next Steps**

I'm reviewing the excellent progress, including the successful downloads and manual testing completed so far. Now, I am pinpointing the critical next steps required to advance towards a fully functional MarFaNet implementation in the upcoming session. The focus is on optimizing session planning to capitalize on the success.


**Outlining the Immediate Action**

I'm now strongly focused on transitioning from successful builds to tangible device validation. My top priority is guiding the user to download, install, and manually test the APK. This decisive step directly addresses the "fully functional version" goal, bridging the gap between successful builds and an app that truly works from the user's perspective. I'm thinking we will then iterate, addressing any discovered bugs.


**Determining the Primary Action**

I'm zeroing in on the core objective of a "fully functional version." We've laid a solid foundation with builds and tests. The next crucial move is getting the APK onto a device and conducting hands-on testing. This pivotal step is what validates true functionality from the user's standpoint, and I'm structuring the next session's guidance around that. This is the bridge between code and practical usability.


Okay, this is excellent! You've provided a perfect summary of what's been achieved.

To get "a fully functional version" now, the critical next step is to **directly engage with the APK that has been successfully built.** All the previous work was about building confidence in the *build process*. Now, it's about building confidence in the *application itself*.

For your next session, you should instruct the AI agent to help you:

**Prioritize: Get the APK and Start Manual Testing**

You need to manually verify that everything works as expected on an actual device or emulator. This is where your coding efforts translate into a real, usable application.

Here's what you should instruct the AI agent to assist with:

1. **"Help me download the latest working APK artifact."**
  *  The agent already confirmed the APK was generated and hopefully uploaded. You'll need the direct download link for the `.zip` file containing the `app-debug.apk`.

2. **"Guide me on how to install the APK on an Android device/emulator."**
  *  The AI can provide step-by-step instructions (e.g., enabling "Install from unknown sources" if needed, using `adb install`, or dragging onto an emulator).

3. **"Let's create a manual testing checklist for the MarFaNet features."**
  *  This is crucial. The AI can help you outline a plan to verify all the advanced features you've implemented (routing rules, split-tunneling, WireGuard, stats, theming). This ensures you systematically test everything.

**Why this is the "next level" for a "fully functional version":**

*  **Real-world functionality:** Automated tests are vital, but they can't fully replicate a user's experience. Manual testing checks UI/UX, device compatibility, performance, and integrates functionality in ways automated tests sometimes miss.
*  **Bug identification:** If there are runtime bugs or unexpected behavior in the app (that didn't cause a test failure), manual testing will reveal them.
*  **User readiness:** An app isn't "fully functional" until it's proven stable and usable on a device.

By getting the APK onto a device and systematically testing it, you bridge the gap from a "build that works" to an "app that works."

**So, for your next session:**

"**Great! For our next session, let's focus on getting the working APK and initiating comprehensive manual testing. Please, guide me on how to download and install the latest APK artifact, and then help me organize a detailed manual testing checklist for all the MarFaNet features.**"
