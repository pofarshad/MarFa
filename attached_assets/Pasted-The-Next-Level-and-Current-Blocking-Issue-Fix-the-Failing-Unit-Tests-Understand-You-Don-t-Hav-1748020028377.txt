The "Next Level" (and Current Blocking Issue): Fix the Failing Unit Tests.
Understand You Don't Have a Clean APK from This Run:

The assembleDebug task should generate the debug APK.
If you simply run ./gradlew assembleDebug, it should produce an APK (even if tests are failing, as assembleDebug doesn't depend on testDebugUnitTest by default, but build does).
However, for a complete, successful build, all tasks must pass, and that includes your unit tests.
Focus on the Test Failures:

You have 5 failing tests in RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
The previous analysis gave you the exact lines for the AssertionError and IllegalStateException.
This is the current technical challenge you need to solve.
To solve it, you need to debug the tests locally using Android Studio (as previously discussed). This involves setting breakpoints and stepping through the code to understand precisely why your Worker is not behaving as the tests expect it to, or why the test setup/assertions are incorrect.
Debugging Tests: Review the Test Report:

The log explicitly tells you there's a test report: file:///home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/app/build/reports/tests/testDebugUnitTest/index.html.
Unfortunately, you can't access this in GitHub Actions directly on the console. If you were building locally, you could open this HTML file in your browser to get a more detailed breakdown of each failing test, including stack traces and system output for that specific test run, potentially giving you more clues.
In summary of "what's next level":

Your project is in an excellent state where compilation is no longer an issue, but the core logic (as validated by your tests) is failing.

Generate a Debug APK (Optional Short-Term Goal):
If you just want an APK right now even with failing tests, you can try running ./gradlew assembleDebug on its own (not build). This task doesn't depend on successful unit tests, so it should produce an APK if all other compilation pieces are in place. But remember, this APK might have bugs in the RoutingRulesUpdateWorker functionality.
Primary Goal: Fix the Failing Tests (Required for a "Green" Build):
Get your project running in Android Studio.
Debug RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt step-by-step using breakpoints.
Determine if the bug is in your RoutingRulesUpdateWorker code (likely) or in the test's expectations.
Once all tests pass, your gradlew build command will finally complete successfully!
