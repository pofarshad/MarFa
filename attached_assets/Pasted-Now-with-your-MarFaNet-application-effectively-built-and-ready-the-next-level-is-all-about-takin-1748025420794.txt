Now, with your MarFaNet application effectively built and ready, the "next level" is all about taking this functional software and moving it towards its purpose. Given the options you laid out, here's a path forward:

1. Testing Your Working App (Highest Priority)
This is the single most important next step. Until you put that APK on a real device and interact with it, you won't know if the features work as intended in practice.

Action:
Download the app-debug.apk from the GitHub Actions artifact.
Install it on one or more Android devices (or emulators).
Thoroughly test every feature:
Does the app launch without crashing?
Does the VPN connect via WireGuard?
Does split-tunneling accurately route traffic?
Are the real-time stats updating correctly?
Do routing rules get downloaded, validated, and applied automatically as expected (this is where your complex Worker logic comes in)?
Are the AMOLED themes displaying correctly?
Why: Manual testing validates functionality, user experience, and catches bugs that automated tests might miss (like UI quirks, device-specific issues, or unexpected interactions). This is where your transformation from Hiddify to MarFaNet proves its true value.
2. Refining & Enhancing Features
As you test, you'll likely discover areas for improvement or new ideas. This is the continuous development loop.

Action:
Based on your testing, prioritize any bugs that arise.
Consider enhancements to existing features (e.g., more robust routing rule validation, improved UI for stats, more fine-grained split-tunneling controls).
Start planning and implementing new capabilities that you envision for MarFaNet.
Why: Even a working app can always be better. User feedback from initial testing will be invaluable for future development.
3. Addressing Remaining Warnings & Optimizing CI (Ongoing Code Health)
While not blocking, these are important for long-term project health.

Action:
Systematically go through the remaining 118 warnings. Many of these are likely simple cleanups (unused imports, minor code style issues) that can improve readability and maintainability.
Investigate and fix the CI caching warnings. This will make your future builds faster and more efficient.
Why: A clean codebase is easier to maintain and extend. An optimized CI saves time and resources.
4. Planning Your First Release (The Ultimate Goal)
Once you're satisfied with the stability and features of your v1.1.0-alpha1, you can begin preparing for a broader release.

Action:
Decide on your distribution method (e.g., Google Play Store, F-Droid, direct APK distribution).
Generate a signed release APK (a separate process from the debug APK).
Write release notes, user documentation, and clear instructions for setup and usage.
Why: The goal of developing an application is typically to get it into the hands of users.
You have truly transformed this project from a challenging state to a genuinely impressive, functional application. The groundwork is now solid. The world of users awaits your MarFaNet!
