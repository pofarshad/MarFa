It seems the AI agent's assessment that "I've successfully configured both failing components" was premature, and the build is still failing on both those fronts.

Here's a breakdown of the specific problems:

Problem 1 (Critical): Detekt Baseline (Or Lack Thereof) causing failure
The Lint & Static Analysis job explicitly runs ./gradlew detekt.

> Task :app:detekt FAILED
Analysis failed with 177 weighted issues.
What it means:
The Detekt plugin is now correctly applied (it found the "detekt" task and started analyzing code). However, it failed because it found a large number of code quality issues (177 weighted issues).

The AI agent claimed it "Fixed Detekt Code Analysis by creating a baseline file that temporarily ignores the 177 existing code quality issues," but this log clearly shows that baseline was either:

Not correctly created.
Not correctly applied in your build.gradle.kts.
Not committed to the repository.
Solution:
You need to ensure the Detekt baseline is properly created and committed. This doesn't fix the code quality issues, but it tells Detekt to ignore the current 177 issues, allowing the build to pass.

Ensure app/build.gradle.kts has the detekt { baseline = file("detekt-baseline.xml") } block:
detekt {
    baseline = file("detekt-baseline.xml")
    // ... other detekt configurations like toolVersion etc.
}
Generate the baseline file locally:
On your local machine, navigate to your project root in the terminal.
Run: ./gradlew detektBaseline
This will create a detekt-baseline.xml file in your app/ directory.
Commit detekt-baseline.xml to your repository: This file must be part of your Git repository so GitHub Actions can find it.
git add app/detekt-baseline.xml
git commit -m "Add Detekt baseline file"
git push
Problem 2 (Critical): OWASP Dependency-Check requires .NET Runtime
The Security Vulnerability Scan explicitly runs ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze.

> Task :app:dependencyCheckAnalyze FAILED
Analysis failed.
An error occurred with the .NET AssemblyAnalyzer, please see the log for more details.
Exception occurred initializing Assembly Analyzer.
dependency-check requires dotnet 6.0 core runtime or sdk to be installed to analyze assemblies.
What it means:
The org.owasp.dependencycheck plugin is now correctly applied (it found the "dependencyCheckAnalyze" task). However, its analysis failed because it's trying to analyze .NET assemblies (which your project might not even have, but it can trigger this check) and it needs the .NET runtime to do so. The GitHub Actions runner environment does not have dotnet 6.0 installed by default.

Solution:
You need to add a step to your GitHub Actions workflow specifically for the Security Vulnerability Scan job that installs the .NET SDK.

Find the YAML file for your Security Vulnerability Scan job (likely in .github/workflows/ and might be a separate .yml file or a job within your main one).
Add a step to install .NET SDK before dependencyCheckAnalyze:
# ... other steps in your Security Vulnerability Scan job (e.g. checkout, setup-java, setup-gradle)
- name: Setup .NET SDK
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4 # Use the official setup-dotnet action
  with:
    dotnet-version: '6.0.x' # Specify dotnet 6.0
- name: Run OWASP Dependency-Check Analysis
  run: ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze
# ... rest of the job
This action will install the necessary dotnet runtime for the dependencyCheckAnalyze task to complete successfully.
Positive Observation (Very Important!): ShieldOff is Fixed!
The previous critical compilation error Unresolved reference: ShieldOff is no longer present in this log! This means the AI agent's fix for adding Material Icons and/or correcting the import was successful. Your core application code is now compiling cleanly. This is a huge win!

Also, the Unit & Instrumentation Tests job is not shown in this log snippet. The fact that the first errors are in detekt and dependencyCheckAnalyze suggests that the overall build command didn't progress far enough to run into the test tasks, or that these jobs are running separately. However, since the Detekt task successfully ran (which requires compilation), this strongly reinforces that your application code compiles correctly now.

Immediate Next Steps (in order of priority for your next commit):

Generate and commit detekt-baseline.xml: Run ./gradlew detektBaseline locally and commit the generated XML file.
Add actions/setup-dotnet@v4 step: Modify the workflow for the Security Vulnerability Scan job to install .NET SDK.
After making these changes and committing them, your CI pipeline should finally achieve a fully green build!
