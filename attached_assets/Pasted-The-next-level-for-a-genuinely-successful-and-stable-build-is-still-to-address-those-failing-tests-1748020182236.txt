The "next level" for a genuinely successful and stable build is still to address those failing tests.

Here's why and what to do:

A "Successful Build" Means All Tasks Pass: In a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, a "successful" build isn't just one that compiles; it's one where all defined tasks, including tests, pass. If tests are failing, the overall build job on GitHub Actions will still be marked as "failed," even if an APK was produced by using --continue. You want a build that is fully green.

Failing Tests Indicate Bugs or Incorrect Logic: Those AssertionError and IllegalStateException messages are telling you that the code being tested (your RoutingRulesUpdateWorker and related logic) is not behaving as expected, or that the tests themselves have incorrect expectations. Ignored failing tests lead to unreliable software.

The APK Might Not Reflect Correct Behavior: If you get an APK while tests are failing, that APK might contain bugs in the very functionality those tests are designed to cover (e.g., how routing rules are downloaded, saved, or updated).

What We Should Focus On Now (What "Next Level" Truly Means):

The next truly significant step for your MarFaNet project is to make all those tests pass.

Priority: Fine-tune the Routing Rules Tests.
This means diving into the code of app/src/test/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/worker/RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
This requires you to debug the tests locally within Android Studio. This is the critical piece of the puzzle that an AI cannot do. You need to:
Open the project in Android Studio.
Locate RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
Set breakpoints at the lines the log mentioned (151, 69, 130, 185, 46).
Run the tests in Debug mode.
Step through the code line by line, inspect variable values, and understand:
Is the application logic (the RoutingRulesUpdateWorker) doing something different from what you expect? If so, fix the worker code.
Are the tests making incorrect assumptions or asserting against old behavior? If so, update the test code to reflect the correct MarFaNet logic.
In essence, the next level is transforming these build results:

From: "Code compiles, but tests fail" (Current State)
To: "Code compiles, and all tests pass" (True "Next Level")
Once all your tests pass, your gradlew build command will finally give you a universally "green" result, and you'll have high confidence that the APK it produces contains functionality that lives up to its design.
