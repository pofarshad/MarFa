Here's the breakdown of what the log shows:

Detekt Baseline Issue: üî¥ STILL FAILING!
This is the primary reason the gradlew build command failed in this log.

98 > Task :app:detekt FAILED
...
Analysis failed with 177 weighted issues.
The AI agent claimed it "properly addressed the Detekt baseline issue" and "Added explicit baseline flag to the GitHub Actions workflow Detekt command." However, the log clearly shows that the Detekt task is still failing because it's encountering the original 177 weighted issues. This means the Detekt baseline is still not being respected or the detekt-baseline.xml file is not being found/applied correctly.

Missing Job Outputs (Continuing Concern): ‚ùì UNKNOWN
This log output only shows the tasks executed as part of the initial gradlew build command. It does not include the output for:

The "Unit & Instrumentation Tests" job (which runs testDebugUnitTest and createDebugCoverageReport).
The "Security Vulnerability Scan" job (which runs dependencyCheckAnalyze).
This means we still don't have a complete picture of whether those jobs are passing.
What to do for the next session:

The most immediate blocker is getting Detekt to respect its baseline. We need to confirm the baseline is truly being used.

Action 1: Debug and Confirm Detekt Baseline Application
We need to make absolutely sure the Detekt plugin sees and uses the detekt-baseline.xml file.

Verify detekt-baseline.xml existence and content:

On your local machine, navigate to the app/ directory of your project.
Confirm detekt-baseline.xml exists there.
Open the file and check if it has content (it should be an XML file with <Issues> and a list of <Issue> elements, each with a hash attribute).
Make sure this file is committed and pushed to your Git repository. (This is the most common reason for CI to "not see" it).
Verify build.gradle.kts Detekt configuration:

Open app/build.gradle.kts.
Ensure your detekt { ... } block explicitly points to the baseline file, typically like this:
detekt {
    baseline = file("detekt-baseline.xml")
    // Other configurations should be fine, but the baseline line is key
}
Sometimes, if the detekt block is configured in a way that overrides the baseline or runs in a mode that doesn't use it, it can cause this.
Verify GitHub Actions Workflow Command:

Check the exact command being run for Detekt in your GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/your-workflow-file.yml).
It should be something like ./gradlew detekt or ./gradlew detekt --baseline detekt-baseline.xml. If the AI added --baseline, ensure it's still there and correctly formatted.
Action 2: Get a Full Build Output for ALL Three Jobs
We still need to know the state of all three jobs to confirm overall success.

Instructions for the AI agent for the next session:

"Okay, the detekt task is still failing with the same 177 issues. This indicates the baseline is still not being used correctly.

For our next session, let's focus on:

Detekt Baseline Verification:

Please confirm directly that the detekt-baseline.xml file exists in the app/ directory, that it contains the XML with the 177 issue hashes, and that it has been committed to the repository.
Double-check the detekt { baseline = file("detekt-baseline.xml") } configuration in app/build.gradle.kts.
Confirm the exact command being run for Detekt in the GitHub Actions workflow, including any --baseline flags.
Complete Build Log for All Jobs:

Please trigger a full build process again.
Most importantly, ensure the complete log for all three jobs is provided:
The main application build (including compileDebugKotlin results to confirm ShieldOff is still genuinely resolved).
The detekt job itself (with results, hopefully passing).
The dependencyCheckAnalyze job (to confirm its status).
We need to see all three jobs running and passing to confirm a fully green build for MarFaNet!"
