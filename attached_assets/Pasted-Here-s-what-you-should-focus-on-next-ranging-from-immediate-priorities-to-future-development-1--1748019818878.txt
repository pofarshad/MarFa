Here's what you should focus on next, ranging from immediate priorities to future development:

1. Immediate Priority: Get Your First Working APK!
Action: In your GitHub Actions workflow, after the testDebugUnitTest task, you should typically have a task (or a series of tasks) that assembles the debug or release APK.
Look for tasks like :app:assembleDebug or :app:bundleRelease (or similar for .apk generation if not already done automatically by build).
Why: You've built all the components successfully. It's time to get a tangible output. This will allow you to:
Manually test the app on a device or emulator. This is crucial to verify that the core functionality you've integrated (split-tunneling, WireGuard, real-time stats overlay) actually works from an end-user perspective.
Share the APK with others for early feedback.
Celebrate! You've earned it.
2. Next Critical Step: Fix the Failing Tests
Action: As discussed, the tests are failing due to AssertionError and IllegalStateException within RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
Local Debugging: This is where you, as the human developer, shine.
Open the project in Android Studio.
Navigate to app/src/test/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/worker/RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest.kt.
Set breakpoints at the lines indicated in the log (151, 69, 130, 46 for AssertionError and 185 for IllegalStateException).
Run the tests in debug mode (right-click on the test file or method and select "Debug").
Step through the code, inspect variable values, and understand why the actual result isn't matching the expected result, or why an illegal state is being reached.
Possible causes for test failures:
Bugs in your application logic: The RoutingRulesUpdateWorker might not be behaving as expected.
Outdated test logic: The tests might be written for the original "Hiddify" behavior and haven't been updated to reflect the "MarFaNet" specifications (e.g., changes to routing rules, file handling, network interaction).
Incorrect test setup/mocking: Your tests might not be properly setting up the environment for the Worker, leading to unexpected behavior.
Why: Passing tests are your first line of defense against bugs. They ensure that your features work as intended and that future changes don't break existing functionality (prevent regressions). A green CI build is a strong indicator of code quality and stability.
3. Quality Improvements (Ongoing):
Address Old Warnings:
w: file:///home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/build.gradle.kts:8:24: 'getter for buildDir: File!' is deprecated. (Resolve buildDir usage)
WARNING: The option setting 'android.defaults.buildfeatures.buildconfig=true' is deprecated. (Migrate BuildConfig)
'scaledDensity: Float' is deprecated. Deprecated in Java (Update usage of scaledDensity in AccessibilityManager.kt)
Parameter 'response' is never used, could be renamed to _ (Minor cleanup in RuleUpdateManager.kt)
'versionCode: Int' is deprecated. (Update usage of versionCode)
These won't break your build immediately, but it's good practice to keep your codebase free of deprecations and warnings.
Improve CI Caching:
Recall the Failed to save cache entry... This legacy service is shutting down, effective April 15, 2025. warnings from GitHub Actions. This indicates your Gradle cache isn't effectively working.
Action: Investigate and update your actions/cache steps in your GitHub Actions workflow to use the latest recommended practices. This will significantly speed up future CI builds.
Code Review and Refactoring: Once the tests are green, consider reviewing the RoutingRulesUpdateWorker and related code. Are there ways to make it more readable, efficient, or maintainable?
4. Feature Development:
Once you have a stable, passing build and tests that provide confidence, then you can fully dive into developing new features for MarFaNet:

Split-tunneling capabilities: Implement and refine these.
WireGuard improvements: Continue to optimize and integrate.
Real-time stats overlay: Enhance its functionality and presentation.
Any other planned features for MarFaNet v1.1.0-alpha1.
In summary:

Generate and Manually Test the APK.
Locally Debug and Fix the Failing Tests (this is your immediate technical challenge).
Address outstanding Warnings and CI Caching.
Then, Continue Developing New Features!
