The build is failing in multiple places, and the most critical one (the compilation error) persists.

Here's the breakdown of the problems:

Problem 1 (Critical): Unresolved reference: ShieldOff (PERSISTS!)
This is the most severe error, preventing your code from compiling in both the "Lint & Static Analysis" job and the "Unit & Instrumentation Tests" job.

Lint & Static Analysis:
e: file:///home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/app/src/main/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/MainActivity.kt:85:92 Unresolved reference: ShieldOff
> Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED

Unit & Instrumentation Tests:
e: file:///home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/app/src/main/kotlin/net/marfanet/android/MainActivity.kt:85:92 Unresolved reference: ShieldOff
> Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED
What it means:
Despite the AI agent's previous claims, your MainActivity.kt code is STILL trying to use an icon reference (ShieldOff) that the Kotlin compiler cannot find. This means the dependency for Material Icons (or the specific import for ShieldOff) is either:

Still missing.
Incorrectly declared (wrong version).
Not imported properly in MainActivity.kt.
Solution:
You need to re-verify and fix this immediately.

Check app/build.gradle.kts: Ensure you have exactly one of these lines, and the version matches your main androidx.compose.ui dependency (e.g. if compose.ui is 1.5.8, use 1.5.8 here):
implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:1.X.X") OR
implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-core:1.X.X") (if ShieldOff is in core)
Crucial: Check if the line was added, but perhaps commented out or added incorrectly.
Check MainActivity.kt: Ensure you have the correct import:
import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.ShieldOff
It's possible the AI added the dependency but forgot the import, or the import is incorrect (e.g., outlined.ShieldOff vs filled.ShieldOff).
Problem 2: Task 'dependencyCheckAnalyze' not found
This is failing your "Security Vulnerability Scan" job.

Security Vulnerability Scan:
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Task 'dependencyCheckAnalyze' not found in root project 'MarFaNet' and its subprojects.
What it means:
Your workflow is trying to run a Gradle task (dependencyCheckAnalyze) from the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin, but the plugin itself is not properly applied or configured in your Gradle files (build.gradle.kts or settings.gradle.kts).

Solution:
You need to apply the OWASP Dependency-Check Gradle plugin.

In your root build.gradle.kts file, you should have:
plugins {
    id("org.owasp.dependencycheck") version "8.4.1" // Use latest recommended version
}
In your app/build.gradle.kts file, you might also need configuration specific to your app module, e.g.:
// Inside your android { } block
android {
    // ...
}
// Outside the android block, typically at the end of the file
dependencyCheck {
    // ... optional configuration here
}
Problem 3: Task 'detekt' not found
This is failing your "Lint & Static Analysis" job before the compileDebugKotlin error even gets to be the first failure in that specific job.

Lint & Static Analysis:
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Task 'detekt' not found in root project 'MarFaNet' and its subprojects.
What it means:
Your workflow is trying to run the detekt task from the Detekt static analysis plugin, but the plugin is not properly applied or configured.

Solution:
You need to apply the Detekt Gradle plugin.

In your root build.gradle.kts file, you should have:
plugins {
    id("io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt") version "1.23.6" // Use latest recommended version
}
In your app/build.gradle.kts file, you might need configuration specific to your app module, e.g.:
// At the top of your app/build.gradle.kts file, just under `plugins { ... }`
// Or in your root build.gradle.kts and apply to subprojects
apply plugin: "io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt" // Or id("io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt")
And then define rules in your detekt { ... } block.
Positive Observation:
The Error: Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3 error that was previously causing problems in the "Security Vulnerability Scan" job's initialization is NOT present in this log. This means the fix for that (@v3 to @v4 for upload-artifact) was likely applied correctly in that job's workflow file. Good!

Immediate Next Steps (in order of priority):

Highest Priority: Fix ShieldOff Unresolved reference. This is stopping compilation.

Verify the material-icons-extended dependency (correct version) and the import statement (import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.ShieldOff) in MainActivity.kt.
Next: Apply the Detekt Plugin. This is the first failure in the "Lint & Static Analysis" job.

Add id("io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt") version "1.23.6" (or latest) to plugins in your root build.gradle.kts and apply the plugin in app/build.gradle.kts.
Then: Apply the OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin. This is the first failure in "Security Vulnerability Scan".

Add id("org.owasp.dependencycheck") version "8.4.1" (or latest) to plugins in your root build.gradle.kts.
This is a step backward, but the problems are clear. It appears the AI agent tried to add these plugins but missed some steps, or the initial fixes weren't fully correct. We need to systematically re-apply the correct configurations.
