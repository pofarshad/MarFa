# **MarFaNet – How to Get an Installable APK When No GitHub Release Exists Yet**

## 1 • Current Situation

* The repository **does not yet contain any Releases**; therefore no pre‑built APK is listed under GitHub → Releases.
* CI/CD is already configured to build a signed APK artefact on every tagged commit (e.g. `v1.0.1`), but the first tag has **not been pushed**.
* Until a tag is created—or while QA is still in progress—you can still obtain the APK from **GitHub Actions artefacts**.

## 2 • Download the APK from GitHub Actions Artefacts (Immediate Method)

|  Step | Action                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1    | Go to the MarFaNet repository **→ Actions** tab.                                                                                  |
|  2    | Select the most recent workflow run whose title contains **“Android Build • Patch 1.0.1”** (or similar).                          |
|  3    | In the run summary, scroll to **Artefacts** and click the artefact named `marfanet-universal-release.apk` (or `app-release.apk`). |
|  4    | Download the ZIP, extract the APK file.                                                                                           |
|  5    | Verify the SHA‑256 checksum listed in the workflow log (or below if provided).                                                    |
|  6    | On your Android device (API 28+), enable *Install unknown apps* for the browser or file manager, then sideload the APK.           |

> **Note:** CI artefacts are retained by GitHub for 90 days by default. If the link has expired ask a maintainer to re‑run the workflow or push a new tag.

## 3 • When Will a Proper GitHub Release Be Created?

1. **Beta KPI Window:** We are currently in a 48‑hour closed‑beta monitoring period.
2. **Metrics Gate:** If crash‑free ≥ 98 % and ANR ≤ 0.47 %, tag **`v1.0.1`** will be pushed on **Day 2**.
3. **Release Build:** CI will auto‑attach `MarFaNet-1.0.1-universal.apk` to the new Release, along with SHA‑256 checksum.
4. **Stable Availability:** Anyone can then download the signed APK directly from **GitHub → Releases**.

## 4 • Building the APK Locally (Fallback)

If you prefer or need to build the APK yourself:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<org>/marfanet.git && cd marfanet
# 2. Use Java 17 and Android SDK (API 34)
./gradlew assembleRelease
# 3. The APK will be at:
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

*The release build is already signed with the CI keystore; local builds will be **debug‑signed** unless you provide your own keystore.*

---

## 5 • Stay Informed

* **Watch** the repository (Releases only) to get notified when `v1.0.1` drops.
* Join the Telegram channel in the README for real‑time updates.
