Okay, let's break down this new log the way we always do.

First, I acknowledge the white screen issue you're seeing in the app. That's a runtime problem, and the AI agent was correct to try and address it in the code. However, this latest error is NOT related to the white screen problem itself.

Current Problem: GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration Error

The build failed very early, before your Gradle project even started configuring or building.

Look at this line:

33 Error: Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3
What this means:

Your GitHub Actions workflow uses a pre-built action called actions/upload-artifact to upload artifacts (like your compiled APKs or test reports) after the build.
The workflow specifies to use version @v3 of this action.
For some reason (could be a transient issue, or more commonly, that specific version tag has been deprecated/moved/changed by GitHub), the GitHub Actions runner cannot find or download the required metadata for actions/upload-artifact@v3.
This error is preventing your code from even being checked out and compiled, so any changes your AI agent made to fix the white screen issue are not being built or tested yet.

The Solution:

The most common fix for this type of GitHub Actions action versioning error is to update the version of the action to the latest stable one.

Open your GitHub Actions workflow file: This is usually located at .github/workflows/your-workflow-file.yml (e.g., android-ci.yml).

Find the line(s) using actions/upload-artifact@v3.

Change @v3 to @v4.

It will look something like this in your YAML file:

# Before
- name: Upload Debug APK
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: marfanet-debug-apk
    path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# After - CHANGE v3 to v4
- name: Upload Debug APK
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 # <-- Change this line
  with:
    name: marfanet-debug-apk
    path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
You might have multiple upload-artifact steps (e.g., for release APK, test reports). Make sure you update all of them if they are using @v3.

Once you make this small change in your workflow file and commit it, the next build should pass this initial step and proceed to compile your code (including the AI agent's changes for the white screen).
