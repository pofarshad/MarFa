Root Cause of the Failure
The main build failure is due to a Gradle error in your GitHub Actions workflow:

Code
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* Where:
Initialization script '/home/runner/work/_temp/dummy-cleanup-project/init.gradle' line: 8
* What went wrong:
Cannot get the value of write-only property 'removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan' for object of type org.gradle.api.internal.cache.DefaultCacheConfigurations$DefaultCacheResourceConfiguration.
What this means
The error is triggered by an initialization script (init.gradle) used during a "post-job cleanup" step of your GitHub Action.
The script is trying to read the value of a write-only property: removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan on a Gradle internal object. In Gradle, some properties can only be set, not read.
This usually means the script or an action you’re using is not compatible with this version of Gradle, or is incorrectly implemented.
Additional Observations
1. Caching warnings and errors
You are seeing multiple warnings like:

Code
ReserveCacheError: Unable to reserve cache with key ... another job may be creating this cache. More details: This legacy service is shutting down, effective April 15, 2025.
These are not the cause of your build failure, but they do point to a coming problem:
GitHub is sunsetting its legacy cache service. You should update your caching actions to use the new service: See details and migration instructions
These errors are warnings about caching and do not break your build directly.
2. Gradle version
You are using both Gradle 8.6-rc-1 and Gradle 8.14.1 in your workflow.
There may be a version mismatch or an outdated script not compatible with Gradle 8.14.1.
How to Fix
A. Fix the Gradle init script error
Locate the script
The error is in: /home/runner/work/_temp/dummy-cleanup-project/init.gradle, line 8.
If you’re using a third-party GitHub Action for Gradle or custom scripts, update them to the latest version.
If this is your own script, check any line that refers to removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan.
Do not try to read this property
Set this property if needed, but never read it.
Example (OK):
Groovy
cacheConfig.removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan = 30
Example (problematic!):
Groovy
println cacheConfig.removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan // <-- Do not do this
Update Gradle Action
Ensure you are using the latest gradle/actions and that any referenced scripts/plugins are compatible with your Gradle version.
B. Update GitHub Actions Cache
Migrate your workflow to use the new cache service before April 15, 2025.
Update actions to use the latest actions/cache.
Super Prompt Summary
Your build failed because your Gradle initialization script tried to read a write-only property (removeUnusedEntriesOlderThan). This is not permitted and causes the build to fail. Fix the script so it only sets this property, not reads it.

Secondary warnings about cache service deprecation do not cause the build to fail, but you should update your workflow soon to use the new GitHub cache service.
