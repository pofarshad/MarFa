It seems the AI agent's approach to fixing Detekt by "disabling rule categories" was incorrect and introduced new configuration errors, leading to the build still failing on Detekt.

Here's the breakdown of what happened:

Detekt Failing on Invalid Configuration (New Problem):

> Task :app:detekt FAILED
...
Execution failed for task ':app:detekt'.
> Run failed with 6 invalid config properties.
  - Property 'style>FunctionNaming' is misspelled or does not exist.
  - Property 'style>VariableNaming' is misspelled or does not exist.
  - Property 'style>ClassNaming' is misspelled or does not exist.
  - Property 'style>PackageNaming' is misspelled or does not exist.
  - Property 'style>PropertyNaming' is misspelled or does not exist.
  - Property 'formatting' is misspelled or does not exist.
  - Property 'complexity>ComplexMethod' is deprecated.
This is not the same failure as before. Previously, it simply listed the 177 issues and failed. Now, it's failing because the configuration for Detekt itself is invalid. The AI's attempt to "temporarily disable the most problematic rule categories" likely involved adding these invalid properties to your detekt configuration block in build.gradle.kts.
The 177 issues are still listed in the log output because Detekt still parses your code, but the run fails because of the bad configuration before it can even decide to fail based on those issues.
Missing Complete Log for All Jobs (Still an Issue):

This log output only shows the tasks executed by the gradlew build command. It does not include the separate outputs for the "Security Vulnerability Scan" job or the "Unit & Instrumentation Tests" job if they are running as parallel jobs in your GitHub Actions workflow.
This means we still cannot confirm the status of dependencyCheckAnalyze or ensure that compileDebugKotlin (the ShieldOff fix) and testDebugUnitTest (all tests passing) are consistently succeeding without a full log.
What to do for the next session:

We need to address the bad Detekt configuration and still ensure we see the full build output.

Action 1: Correct the Detekt Configuration (Crucial)
We need to revert the changes the AI agent made regarding "disabling rule categories" and go back to the reliable baseline approach.

Locate Detekt Configuration: Open your app/build.gradle.kts file (or your root build.gradle.kts if Detekt is configured there).
Remove Invalid Properties: Look for any detekt { ... } block and remove any properties related to style, formatting, or complexity that were introduced by the AI agent, specifically the ones listed in the error:
style>FunctionNaming
style>VariableNaming
style>ClassNaming
style>PackageNaming
style>PropertyNaming
formatting
complexity>ComplexMethod (If this was explicitly in config).
Ensure Baseline is Correctly Applied: Make sure your detekt { ... } block looks like this (or similar, depending on existing config):
detekt {
    baseline = file("detekt-baseline.xml") // This line is key
    // other valid configurations and exclusions can remain
}
Regenerate and Re-Commit Baseline (if recent changes):
On your local machine, run: ./gradlew detektBaseline
Commit the newly generated detekt-baseline.xml file to your Git repository and push the changes. This is vital, it must be in Git.
Action 2: Get a Complete Build Log for ALL Jobs
We need to see the success or failure of dependencyCheckAnalyze and confirm that your compile and test tasks are passing.

Instructions for the AI agent for the next session:

"Okay, the Detekt task is now failing because the configuration changes you made introduced invalid properties. The previous baseline approach is more reliable.

For our next attempt to get a fully green build, let's focus on:

Correcting Detekt Configuration:

Revert any recent manual changes to the Detekt configuration in build.gradle.kts that introduced invalid properties like style>FunctionNaming or formatting.
Ensure the detekt { baseline = file("detekt-baseline.xml") } configuration is correctly set up.
Make sure detekt-baseline.xml is up-to-date and committed to the repository (if changes are made locally, ensure they are pushed).
Providing a Full Build Output:

Please trigger a full build process again.
Crucially, ensure the complete log for all three jobs is provided, in sequence if possible:
The main application build (including compileDebugKotlin results to confirm ShieldOff is still genuinely resolved).
The detekt job (to confirm the baseline works and no longer introduces config errors).
The dependencyCheckAnalyze job (to see if the .NET SDK setup worked last time, as we didn't see its output).
We need to see all three jobs running and passing to confirm a fully green build this time!"
