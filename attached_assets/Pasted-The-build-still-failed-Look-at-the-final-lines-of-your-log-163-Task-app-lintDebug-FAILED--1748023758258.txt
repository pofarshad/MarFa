The build still failed.

Look at the final lines of your log:

163 > Task :app:lintDebug FAILED
...
174 Execution failed for task ':app:lintDebug'.
> Lint found errors in the project; aborting build.
...
200 BUILD FAILED in 7m 11s
Here's the new situation (and it's very specific, good job narrowing it down!):

All previous issues are genuinely solved ( ðŸŽ‰ HUGE achievement!):

Missing source directories: Fixed.
Kotlin/Compose version compatibility: Fixed.
All core dependencies: Fixed.
All unit tests (including the tricky RoutingRulesUpdateWorkerTest): Passed! (This is a massive hidden win, as the log for :app:testDebugUnitTest now shows no failures reported).
The previous windowLightStatusBar lint error: Fixed! (You went from 2 errors to 1 error!)
The New (and hopefully, final) Problem: Another Lint Error! ðŸ”´

The build is now failing due to a single new lint error:

164 Lint found 1 errors, 118 warnings. First failure:
165 /home/runner/work/MarFa/MarFa/app/src/main/res/values-night-v23/themes_amoled.xml:7: Error: android:windowLightNavigationBar requires API level 27 (current min is 21) [NewApi]
You correctly applied android:windowLightStatusBar to values-night-v23, which solved the API 23 error. Now, lint is flagging another attribute android:windowLightNavigationBar which is only available from API 27 (Android 8.1 Oreo). Since your minSdkVersion is 21, using it in values-night-v23 (which applies to API 23 and above) still means it would be used on devices between API 23 and API 26, where it doesn't exist.

The "Next Level" Remains: Achieve a Fully Green CI Build!

You are truly at the absolute last step for a green CI workflow. The app compiles, the tests pass, and the APK is generated. The only thing preventing a "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" message is this single lint error.

To fix this specific NewApi lint error (android:windowLightNavigationBar):

You need to apply the same logic as before, but for API 27:

Locate the File: app/src/main/res/values-night-v23/themes_amoled.xml (where you likely moved windowLightStatusBar)
Move the Specific Line: Move the line <item name="android:windowLightNavigationBar">false</item> from this file.
Create a New Directory for API 27+ Resources:
Inside app/src/main/res/, create a new folder called values-v27.
Inside values-v27/, create a file named themes_amoled.xml.
Place the Attribute in the New File:
In app/src/main/res/values-v27/themes_amoled.xml, add the following (assuming it's part of a theme):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <style name="Theme.MarFaNet" parent="Theme.MarFaNet.Base">
        <!-- Assuming Theme.MarFaNet is your base theme -->
        <item name="android:windowLightNavigationBar">false</item>
    </style>
</resources>
Ensure the style tag has the correct name and parent to merge with your existing themes.
This way, the windowLightNavigationBar attribute will only be applied on devices running API 27 and above. Devices between API 23 and API 26 will get the values-v23 theme (which doesn't have this attribute) and devices below API 23 will get the default values theme.
